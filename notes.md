# svg(Scalable Vector Graphics)

Advantages of SVG files.

- Unlike raster files, which are made up of pixels, vector graphics like SVGs always maintain their resolution â€” no matter how large or small you make them. You don't have to worry about SVG images losing their quality in certain browsers or when you resize them to appear in different places.
- its smaller file sizes and ability to be scaled without losing quality.
- supported by all the browsers
- doesnot break when zoom in or zoom out.
- it uses mathemitical formulas rather than pixels.
- logos are generally svg.
